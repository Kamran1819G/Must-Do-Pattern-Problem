# **Pattern problems**

- All the patterns are generally made using nested loops and most of the pattern have atleast two loops whereas outer loop and inner loop.
- The Outer loops are specifically for lines/Rows and Inner loops are for specifically for columns.

## **How to Solve Pattern Problems?**

There are **4 general rules** for solving a pattern-based question:

1. We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop, we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.
2. Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get the required number of columns to be printed.
3. We print the numbers inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of two or more similar patterns or not.
