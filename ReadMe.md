# **Pattern problems**

- All the patterns are generally made using nested loops and most of the pattern have atleast two loops whereas outer loop and inner loop.
- The Outer loops are specifically for lines/Rows and Inner loops are for specifically for columns.

## **How to Solve Pattern Problems?**

1. For Outer loop, count the number of lines.
2. For the Inner loop, focus on columns and connect them somehow to the Rows.
3. Whatever you are printing, print them inside the inner for-loop.
4. **[Optional]** Observe symmetry in case of some patterns.
